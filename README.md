## Ruleset Aims 
 
This ruleset aims to broaden the appeal of Survival, by addressing some common complaints both we and others had towards the original ruleset. 

Furthermore, we have attempted to structure a challenge that encourages creativity, problem solving and planning. The hypest moments are usually ones where the runner makes bold and unique plays that others may not have seen or attempted, we want to see and create more of those special moments. 

If you're interested in helping create an adaptation for Emerald, HGSS etc. then please message Reimi either in chat or on Discord. 

We're very open to feedback and will potentially make adjustments if needed in the future. We hope you enjoy and good luck on your runs! 


**Super Kaizo Rules do not apply! No Safari Pivot, no Smart AI or Held items on all trainers**

Such as Leech Seed/Giga Drain/Aromatherapy and so forth    Moves that heal HP without hurting the opponent like Softboiled/Morning Sun/Wish are still banned. | Pain Split is an exception and not legal.

| Trials of Knowledge | Full-clearing certain dungeons is rewarded with one-time use of specific move tutors. | Game specific lists are available below. |
| PP Limit | You may only use 1 PP Up on each move. PP Max's may not be used at all, but you may "trade-in" each PP max by selling it and buying a Hyper Potion. | When trading a PP Max, in place of a hyper potion you may also opt for an equivalent amount of healing using other items like 4 super potions. |

This includes Everstones to prevent evolving! | The following Held items are still banned: Lucky egg, Leftovers, Shell Bell, focus band and brightpowder.
