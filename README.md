## Ruleset Aims 
 
We have created a ruleset that aims to broaden the appeal of Survival, by addressing some common complaints both we and others had towards the original ruleset. 

Furthermore, we have attempted to structure a challenge that encourages creativity, problem solving and planning. The hypest moments are usually ones where the runner makes bold and unique plays that others may not have seen or attempted, we want to see and create more of those special moments. 

We are very open to feedback and will likely make some adjustements early on, but we think we have the bones here for something really interesting.  We hope you enjoy and good luck on your runs! 


## General Rules for All Games

ALL PREVIOUS [Standard, Ultimate, and Kaizo rules](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1) apply (unless overridden by a Survival Revival rule below)!

| Rules | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Swift Beginnings | ALL banned moves, items and Pok√©mon may be used while labbing and pivoting. The normal restrictions on moves, abilities and BST apply once you begin the first non-rival battle.   |
| Stored Power  | Your randomly selected team can use any additional unlocks you have at your disposal - i.e. Shinies, IVs, Egg Moves, Abilities etc.  |
| Flying Blind | You cannot buy the map item, biome selection is random.  |
| Savvy Shopper | You can only buy up to one item from the fixed pool per stage, random items will not count against this. |
| Permadeath | A Pokemon that faints can no longer be used in fights or intentionally revived for the rest of the run. You may transfer its items to other party members before releasing/replacing it. Reviver seeds are allowed to prevent fainting.  |
| One Shot | No save scumming whatsoever, if a server issue/bug occurs then replay the fight in the exact same way up until that point. |
| No Dupes | You can only have one Pokemon of any specific species/line in your team (including fused Pokemon) eg. One Zigzagoon/Linoone/Obstagoon/Fusion with any of these  |
| Mad Scientist | You MUST fuse 2 of your Pokemon if the DNA Splicer is in the shop. You cannot unsplice any fusions during the run. |
| Power Limiter | You cannot start the run with any Pokemon 580 BST or higher, catching or evolving into them mid-run is fine.  |
| Plan Ahead | You may catch any Pokemon you like, even if it breaks the above rules such as Legendaries or a Shiny of a species you already own. However, you cannot use banned Pokemon in battle and must store it in the PC as soon as possible.  |
